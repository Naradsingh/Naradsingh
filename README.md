- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Below is readme about my DevOps goal.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m using this repos only for my test project
- :construction: Iâ€™m currently working on one test project in which Docker image is getting deployed to container by using Docker host 
- :card_file_box: Keeping Docker image on Docker hub
- :wrench: For configuration management using Ansible and for all automated pipeline using jenkins & Azure DevOps.
- :white_check_mark: For test, which I am using SonarQube as pre build testing and Selenium as post building testing tool.
- :rocket: After this will start integrating K8S & Terraform (IAC) in upcoming test project
- ðŸ“« Anyone can reach me at narad.singh@gmail.com
